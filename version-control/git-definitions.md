# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the management of changes made to different files and folders. As files change, we use version control to track what the changes are, and who made them. They can be timestamped so that we can go back to a certain version. It's useful because if at any point, something breaks, you can revert back to a previous version.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a new version of whatever master it's coming from. You would use a branch when you want to change something from the master, but don't want to make it "official" yet. You can work off the branch, but still keep the master in the same state, until you are ready to accept the changes made in the branch, and merge them together.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a snapshot of a version. Commits can be done multiple times before merging the branch into the master. A good commit message will state details about what was changed since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict would happen if there is something that changed in both the master and the branch that didn't sync with each other. I think this is why you would merge your master into your branch before merging your branch back into the master.
