Release 0: Make a Plan
- Even though it said that codecademy might not be the best resource, I think I will start there and just get the basics. If when I google jquery tutorial, and there are other tutorials that seem better, I'll use those. I would like to spend about 30-60 minutes in the tutorial to familiarize myself, and then spend about 30 minutes finding cheatsheets and good resources to bookmark. Then I hope to move on to release 2.
